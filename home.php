		In our project we are researching algorithms based on artificial learning and natural networks that work with social networks, pull from them information about users, posts, comments and pages, cross-referenced them and looking for ways to conclude information about the various relationships between parameters relating the publication of the post and itâ€™s success. Through in-depth analysis of this information we can catalog groups of users, examine their business potential and mapping target audience, what might help stakeholders in the industry to focus its business activities with the relevant population segments.
